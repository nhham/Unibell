CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Amy Rudolph Basketball Tournament\nFriday, February 28, 20256:00 p.m.Hoffman Estates High School - Main Gym\nHoffman Estates High School has hosted the Amy Rudolph Basketball Tournament, now in its 43rd year, in memory of Amy Rudolph, a former student who loved basketball and passed away from a kidney disorder. Her friends started the tradition as a way to honor her. \n Students from neighboring Educational Life Skills classes from Palatine HS, Hersey HS and Kirk School compete in the tournament. It is a Hoffman tradition that is supported by alumni, family members and community members who return each year. We are grateful that the Hoffman Estates Band, Sky Hawks, Poms, Hawk Club, Best Buddies, Partner PE, Co-Ed Cheer, Spirit Squad, Orange Krush-Majorette and Drill Team, and girls and boys basketball players all share their talent and HEHS spirit.
